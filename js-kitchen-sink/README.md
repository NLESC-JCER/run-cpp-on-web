# Run C++ on the web with web assembly, web workers, React and Vega

In previous blogs in the series we learned about

* compile C++ to web assembly
* do not block main thread with web workers
* interactive form with react
* plotting with vega-lite

Those pieces by them selves are useful, but how can all those lessons by combined into a single web application. This blog will tell you how to do build the web application including everyhing but the kitchen sink.
